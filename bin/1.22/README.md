## Install

Windows binaries are available from the [Sheret Releases](https://github.com/ethanpil/sheret/releases) page on GitHub. Download and extract the binary to anywhere on your filesystem. There are no dependencies.

## Usage

![2017-05-26_144823](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/254784/26508345/68218c92-4222-11e7-9692-d8d1d21af680.jpg)

```
Usage: sheret [options]

Parameters:
  -d string
        directory to serve from (default ".")
  
  -f string
  	    log to disk path [./sheret.log]
  
  -p string
        port to serve on (default "8100")
  
  -q    suppress all logging
  
  -b    do not open default browser
  
  -h    show usage help
```

After downloading, you can start Sheret simply with `sheret` from the command line. By default, Sheret will begin serving from the directory it is located, on HTTP port 8100. Sheret will log all activity to the console. To terminate Sheret, simply type **CTRL+C** in the console window.

The console window will log all requests, and pretty print both `URL Parameters` as well as `POST` request variables for easier debugging.

```

```

The **-f** option will enable logging to disk. All console output from Sheret will also be saved in `sheret.log` next to the executable.
